    <p>It downloads the archives for a Scala release

       re-organizes them into the right hierarchy for scala-lang.org/files/archive.</p>
    <p>Also expands api docs for library, reflect, compiler and other modules
       to http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.x/$module (it expands under api/$version
       and updates the api/2.11.x symlink to point there).</p>
    <p>When version ends in -nightly, the root for the expansion process
       is http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/2.11.x/
